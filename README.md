# Sales_Analysis_With_Scala_And_Spark

In the rapidly evolving landscape of e-commerce, data is the backbone of strategic decisions. Over the past months, I embarked on an exciting journey to analyze an enterprise’s online sales data from 2016 to 2017, leveraging Scala, Apache Spark, and the visualization power of Looker Studio. Here’s a detailed walkthrough of the project, its insights, and the technology stack that made it possible.

The Dataset and Project Objective
The dataset comprised two years of sales data, encapsulating 4 tables, containing 871.7k total sales, 7,219 orders, and a customer base of 95,421 individuals, with a fascinating segmentation of frequent and occasional buyers. The core objective was to extract actionable insights, such as identifying key purchasing patterns, top-performing product categories, and geographical trends, and to visualize these findings in an interactive dashboard.

The Tech Stack: Scala, Spark, and Looker Studio
To handle this extensive dataset efficiently, I employed:

Scala and Apache Spark: For high-performance data processing and transformations, Spark’s distributed framework proved invaluable in handling large datasets seamlessly.
Looker Studio: The dashboard served as the project’s visual storytelling layer, enabling stakeholders to explore key metrics and insights interactively.
